Homework for Chem 4050/5050 Computational Problem Solving in the Chemical Sciences
---------------
Homework 5, Monte Carlo simulations, was uploaded on 10/25, you can find the python files and Jupyter notebooks in the folders.
In Homework-5-1, the overlap integral of Hydrogen 2p orbital was computed.
In Homework-5-grad, the diagonal (and off diagonal) kinetic energy matrix element of Hydrogen 1s orbital was computed.
The results were computed by Monte Carlo simulation using both random sampling and importance sampling.
For each question, the plots of the results calculated by different sampling method were also included in the folders.
