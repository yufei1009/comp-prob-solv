## Work Done in an Isothermal Process vs. Adiabatic Process

### Result
For the same change in volume, the work done in the isothermal process is greater than that in the adiabatic process. 

### Explanation
In the **isothermal process**, the temperature is kept constant, and the gas receives heat from the surroundings to maintain the temperature. On the other hand, in the **adiabatic process**, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, and the internal energy of the gas is solely responsible for doing the work. As a result, the temperature of the gas drops during the expansion, and less work is done compared to the isothermal case.
