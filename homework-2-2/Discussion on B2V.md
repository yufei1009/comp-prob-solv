# Discussion on Second Virial Coefficient (B2V) for Different Potentials


## B2V for Hard-Sphere Potential

**The hard-sphere potential has a sharp discontinuity at the distance of sigma.** This results in a purely repulsive interaction for the whole temperature range , leading to **positive values of B2V**. 

  
## B2V for Square-Well Potential

**The square-well potential as a sharp discontinuity at the distance of sigma and lambda-sigma, which introduces both attractive and repulsive interactions.** At low temperatures, the attractive interactions dominate, causing **negative values of B2V**. As temperature increases, the influence of the repulsive interaction becomes more pronounced, resulting in a transition to** positive B2V values at higher temperatures.**
  

## B2V for Lennard-Jones Potential

**The Lennard-Jones potential is continuous function**. It exhibits a smoother transition between attractive and repulsive behaviors compared to the hard-sphere and square-well potentials.
At low temperatures, the attractive interactions dominate and result in **negative B2V values.** As temperature increases, the repulsive interactions begin to dominate, leading to **positive B2V values.**
